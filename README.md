# FormApp_Backend

*** BACKEND ***

Created a backend file named Server.js where we have all the three endpoints

/ping - A GET request that always returns True

/submit - A POST request with parameters "name", "email", "phone", "github_link" and "stopwatch_time"

/read - A GET request with query parameter "index" which is a 0-index for reading the (index+1)th form submission.

*** TO RUN THE BACKEND FILE ***

* Follow this command
* node server.js
